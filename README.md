## Package

No matter which method is used to compile and package, we finally need to generate a package.zip, which contains at
least the following files:

* icon.png
* preview.png
* README*.md
* template.json
* *.md

### Use Github Action

1. In your repo setting page `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/settings/actions`, down to **Workflow Permissions** and open the configuration like this:

    ![](https://github.com/siyuan-note/plugin-sample-vite-svelte/blob/main/asset/action.png?raw=true)

2. Push a tag in the format `v*` and github will automatically create a new release with new bulit package.zip

## List on the marketplace

* Generate the package.zip
* Create a new GitHub release using your new version number as the "Tag version". See here for an
  example: https://github.com/siyuan-note/template-sample/releases
* Upload the file package.zip as binary attachments
* Publish the release

If it is the first release, please create a pull request to
the [Community Bazaar](https://github.com/siyuan-note/bazaar) repository and modify the templates.json file in it. This
file is the index of all community template repositories, the format is:

```json
{
  "repos": [
    "username/reponame"
  ]
}
```

After the PR is merged, the bazaar will automatically update the index and deploy through GitHub Actions. When releasing
a new version of the template in the future, you only need to follow the above steps to create a new release, and you
don't need to PR the community bazaar repo.

Under normal circumstances, the community bazaar repo will automatically update the index and deploy every hour,
and you can check the deployment status at https://github.com/siyuan-note/bazaar/actions.
